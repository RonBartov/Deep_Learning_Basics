# Deep Learning Basics

The current repository houses four projects that were completed as part of a "Deep Learning" course. The course aimed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of Deep Learning, with each project focusing on a specific topic within the field.

All projects were developed using Python and executed on the Google Colab platform. Each project is presented in the form of a Jupyter notebook, containing both the code and a detailed explanation of the problem being addressed and the methods used to solve it.


# Assignments Description
## Assignment 1: Music Century Classification
Build models to predict which century a piece of music was released. The data set is "YearPredictionMSD Data Set", which based on the Million Song Dataset.
In this assignment we implemented manually (i.e without an external library) the Fully Connected Network. 

## Assignment 2: Word Prediction
Build a neural network that can predict the next word in a sentence given the previous three.
In doing this prediction task, we learned about how to represent words, examined the vector representations of words that our model produces, and analyze these representations.

## Assignment 3: Image Classification
Build a convolutional neural network that can predict whether two shoes are from the same pair or from two different pairs. This kind of application can have real-world applications: for example to help people who are visually impaired to have more independence.
We examined two convolutional architectures which differ from each other in the shape of the input images (CNN vs CNN-Channel).

## Assignment 4: Variational Autoencoders
In this assignment, we built, trained and analyzed a variational autoencoders (VAE) with the CelebA dataset. We analyzed how well images can be reconstructed from the lower dimensional representations and tried to generate images that look similar to the images in the CelebA dataset.
