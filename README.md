# Deep_Learning_Basics

The current repository houses four projects that were completed as part of a "Deep Learning" course. The course aimed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of Deep Learning, with each project focusing on a specific topic within the field.

All projects were developed using Python and executed on the Google Colab platform. Each project is presented in the form of a Jupyter notebook, containing both the code and a detailed explanation of the problem being addressed and the methods used to solve it.
